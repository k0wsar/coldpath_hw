# Week 09 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:

* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each color is vulnerable to only 2 of the 6 possible exploits. First discover which color has the specific vulnerability, then write a short description of how to exploit it, and finally demonstrate it using screenshots compiled into a GIF.

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: Session Hijack

Description:

This attack took advantage of the PHP script that was left, and deployed a session hijack. A browser in google chrome was used to log in to a session. The PHP script was then loaded to gain access to the session ID. Then burp intercepted the login page of the site on a Firefox browser. There the session ID was changed to that of the logged in ID from the google browser and forwarded back to Firefox. The result was a successful log in using the hijacked session ID.
